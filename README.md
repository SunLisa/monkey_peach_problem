# monkey_peach_problem
Python script trying to solve a monkey_peach_problem\n

let's say we have 5 monkeys and a whole lot of peaches on a beach.\n
The first monkey consumed 1 peach, and splited the rest of the peaches into 5 equal piles, took his pile, and left the rest on the beach.\n
The second monkey consumed 1 peach, and splited the rest of the peaches into 5 equal piles, took his pile, and left the rest on the beach.\n
The second monkey did so probably because he didn't realize the first monkey had already took his pile.\n
The thrid monkey, fourth monkey, and the fifth monkey all did the same.\n

Question:  How many peaches at lesat were on the beach? And how many peaches were left at each stage?\n
